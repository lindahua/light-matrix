change log for vectorclass.zip
------------------------------

2012-08-01 version 1.02 beta
  * added file vector3d.h for 3-dimensional vectors
  * added file complexvec.h for complex numbers and complex vectors
  * added file quaternion.h for quaternions
  * added function change_sign for floating point vectors
  * added operators +, -, *, / between floating point vectors and scalars to remove overloading ambiguity


2012-07-08 version 1.01 beta
  * added file decimal.h with Number <-> string conversion functions: 
    bin2bcd, bin2ascii, bin2hex_ascii, ascii2bin
  * added andnot function for boolean vectors
  * added functions shift_bytes_up and shift_bytes_down
  * added operators for unsigned integer vector classes: >>=, &, &&, |, ||, ^, ~
  * inteldispatchpatch.cpp removed. Use asmlib instead (www.agner.org/optimize/#asmlib)
  * prefix ++ and -- operators now return a reference, postfix operators return a value
  * various improvements in permute and blend functions
